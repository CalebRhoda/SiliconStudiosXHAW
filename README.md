For our assignment we have been tasked with the creation of a website and mobile app for the fictional organisation: Empower the Nation.

Empower the nation is an organisation whose goal is to educate and upskill impoverished people on a budget, helping people make a living by making them more employable and 
allowing for them to be paid at a higher rate, specifically targeted at domestic workers and gardeners. As this is an institution for learning and upskilling, a lot of design 
choices attempt to display visuals relating to education and progress.

To use this website, download it from github, Unzip the file, open it in VS Code and using the Live Server Extension on VS code you can run the website on your device.

Here is the link to the Website Demonstration: https://youtu.be/QddaLM4Rkro?si=KOwZ9pmnUUrafo1e

On the top of the screen is the navigation bar, use it to move around different parts of the website.

The contact page has a variety of different ways to contact the company such as social media, email and a google map to find local venues

You can also go to the calculate fees page to find out how much these courses cost
